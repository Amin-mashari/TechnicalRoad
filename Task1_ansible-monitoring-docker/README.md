## Task Description
I want to automate the setup of a Linux server using Ansible, making it fully prepared for installing tools to collect metrics and logs. The setup should meet the following requirements:

- Containerized Services: All services should run in containers.
- Persistent Data: Data must remain persistent.
- Preconfigured Settings: All configurations should be set in advance.
- Access and Resource Limits: Access levels and resource consumption must be well-defined.
- Clear Documentation: Write a simple and clear README file for the project.

## Optional Features
These features are not mandatory for this phase but would be great to implement in the future (next month):

- Documentation Publishing: Publish all documentation and resources used (e.g., on a platform like Virgul).
- Automated Server Provisioning: Automate the server creation process itself.
- Server Hardening: Automatically handle server hardening alongside tool installation.
